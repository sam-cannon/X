    "# Prompt Engineering With Dolly\n",
    "Dolly is a language model developed by Databricks. It is a variant of the GPT-3 model, which is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it is given. Dolly has been trained on a diverse range of internet text, but it does not know specific documents or sources it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Dolly Works:**\n",
    "Dolly generates text by predicting the next word in a sentence. It uses the context of the input provided to it to make these predictions. For example, if you provide Dolly with the input \"The sky is\", it might predict the next word to be \"blue\". It continues generating words until it reaches a specified length or until it generates an end-of-sentence token.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros of Dolly:**\n",
    "1. **Versatility:** Dolly can generate a wide variety of content, from stories and poems to technical reports and code.\n",
    "2. **Coherency:** The text generated by Dolly is often coherent and grammatically correct, making it useful for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "3. **Customizability:** You can guide Dolly's output by carefully crafting the input. For example, you can ask it to generate a story in the style of a specific author, or to write a poem about a specific topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons of Dolly:**\n",
    "1. **Lack of Understanding:** Dolly doesn't understand the text it generates. It doesn't have beliefs or desires. It generates text based on patterns it learned during training.\n",
    "2. **Inappropriate Content:** Dolly can sometimes generate inappropriate or biased content, as it learns from the data it was trained on, which includes the biases present in that data.\n",
    "3. **Unpredictability:** It can be hard to predict what Dolly will generate, especially for longer pieces of text. It might not always generate the content you want, and might require multiple attempts to get a satisfactory output.\n"

His applicant quality control process and tight pre-screening procedures allowed for 43 of these young Americans to become active duty members of the Air Force and allowed the squadron to meet mission requirements. His desire to overproduce was readily evident as Sergeant XXX reached 400 percent of his assigned goal during his Recruiter Transition Program period in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2006. This surge in production catapulted him to the top and as such he received the squadron's Top Enlisted Programs Recruiter and coveted Commander's Club award during the same time period.

Furthermore, he participated in the Koi Tash Noncommissioned Officer as part of Theater Security Cooperation Russian and English language exchange enhancing the United States and Kyrgyz Republic partnership.  Finally, his exemplary performance led to his team garnering the 376th Expeditionary Mission Support Group Team of the Month Award for November 2011.,    TYPE1 EPR,  "

    "## Framing the Summarization Problem as a Question & Answering Problem Instead\n",
    "When it comes to summarizing information, Dolly can certainly do the job. However, there are certain advantages to framing the summarization task as a question and answering problem instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specificity**: By asking a question, you can guide Dolly to focus on specific aspects of the information. This can help in generating more relevant summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contextual Understanding**: Dolly is designed to understand context and generate responses accordingly. By asking questions, you can leverage this ability to get more contextually accurate summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactive**: The question and answering approach is more interactive. You can ask follow-up questions based on Dolly's responses to get deeper insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Control**: Questions give you more control over the output. You can ask different types of questions (what, why, how, etc.) to get different perspectives on the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, instructing Dolly to summarize something might result in a more general summary that might not focus on the aspects you're interested in. Therefore, using Dolly for question and answering can often be a more effective approach for summarizing information.\n"

    "## Chaining Models for Batches of Evaluation Bullet Points\n",
    "Performing batch inference has several advantages over feeding Dolly a single, long prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**: Batch inference allows the model to process multiple inputs at once, which can be more efficient than processing a single long input. This is especially true for models that are designed to take advantage of parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware like GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Management**: Long prompts may exceed the model's maximum sequence length (the maximum number of tokens that the model can handle in a single input). In such cases, the prompt needs to be truncated or split into smaller parts, which might affect the context and the quality of the generated output. On the other hand, batch inference can handle larger amounts of data without running into these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality of Output**: When processing a single long prompt, the model might lose context as it generates output, especially if the prompt is near or exceeds the model's maximum sequence length. With batch inference, each input is shorter, allowing the model to maintain better context and potentially produce higher quality output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Speed**: Batch inference can be faster than single inference, especially on hardware that supports parallel processing. This is because the time taken to load the model and perform other setup tasks is amortized over multiple inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for large-scale tasks, batch inference is generally a better choice than feeding a single, long prompt to the model."
